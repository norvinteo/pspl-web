## 8. Design Requirements

### 8.1 Brand Guidelines (Enterprise Premium)

#### Visual Identity

**Current Logo Colors**:
- Coral Red (#C85450) - Signature brand color from "PSP" letters
- Black (#000000) - Used for polishing machine icon and text

**Evolved Website Color Palette**:
Building on the existing brand while elevating for corporate positioning:

- **Primary Colors**: 
  - Refined Coral (#C85450) - Signature brand color, used strategically as accent
  - Marble White (#FAFAF8) - Premium white reflecting core business
  - Corporate Charcoal (#1A1A1A) - Sophisticated alternative to pure black
  - Carrara Grey (#E8E6E1) - Warm-toned grey for backgrounds

- **Accent Colors**:
  - Luxury Gold (#C9A961) - Premium CTAs and highlights
  - Trust Blue (#003D5B) - Corporate credibility elements
  - Success Green (#2E7D32) - Positive states and confirmations

**Color Usage Guidelines**:
- Corporate sections: Primarily whites and charcoals with minimal coral accents
- CTAs: Strategic use of coral for primary actions, gold for premium features
- Trust elements: Blue for certifications, security badges
- Success states: Green for confirmations, completed actions
- Avoid: Overuse of coral - maintain premium perception

**Rationale**: This palette maintains brand recognition through the distinctive coral while positioning PSPL as a luxury partner rather than a typical service provider. The marble-inspired whites and greys directly connect to the business.

- **Typography**:
  - Headers: Didot or Bodoni (luxury serif)
  - Subheaders: Futura or Avenir (geometric sans)
  - Body: Helvetica Neue (professional, readable)
  - Numbers: Tabular figures for data presentation
- **Photography Style**: 
  - Architectural photography only
  - Professional lighting, no smartphone photos
  - Wide-angle shots showing scale
  - People in business attire when shown
- **Icons**: Custom-designed, thin line, sophisticated

#### Design Principles
1. **Enterprise Premium**: Five-star hotel lobby aesthetic
2. **Sophisticated Minimalism**: Maximum white space, editorial layout
3. **Corporate Trust**: Fortune 500 presentation quality
4. **Data-Driven**: Metrics and scale prominently featured
5. **Discreet Luxury**: Understated elegance over flashy design

### 8.2 Animation Strategy (GSAP-Powered)

#### Animation Philosophy
Create subtle, sophisticated movements that enhance the premium experience without distracting from content. Animations should feel like a luxury hotel door opening smoothly—noticed for their quality, not their flashiness.

#### GSAP Implementation Areas

1. **Hero Section**
   ```javascript
   // Parallax marble texture background
   // Smooth reveal of trust badges
   // Staggered fade-in for key metrics
   ```
   - Subtle parallax on scroll (0.3-0.5 speed ratio)
   - Text reveals with SplitText plugin
   - Smooth number counting animations for statistics

2. **Scroll-Triggered Reveals**
   ```javascript
   // Progressive content reveals as user scrolls
   ScrollTrigger.batch(".reveal-element", {
     onEnter: batch => gsap.to(batch, {
       opacity: 1,
       y: 0,
       stagger: 0.15,
       ease: "power3.out"
     })
   });
   ```
   - Fade up animations for sections (subtle 20-30px movement)
   - Staggered reveals for portfolio items
   - Smooth transitions between sections

3. **Before/After Showcase**
   - Draggable slider with momentum
   - Smooth curtain reveal effect
   - Touch-optimized for mobile
   - Optional: 360° rotation for objects

4. **Portfolio Gallery**
   - Magnetic hover effects on project cards
   - Smooth filtering transitions
   - Lightbox with swipe gestures
   - Ken Burns effect on hover

5. **Micro-interactions**
   - Button hover states with subtle scaling
   - Smooth underline animations on links
   - Form field focus transitions
   - Loading states with morphing shapes

6. **Page Transitions**
   - Smooth page-to-page transitions
   - Persistent header transformations
   - Content morphing between states

#### Performance Guidelines

1. **Optimization Strategies**
   - Use `will-change` sparingly
   - Implement lazy loading for heavy animations
   - Reduce animations on mobile devices
   - Use CSS transforms over positional changes
   - Batch DOM updates

2. **Loading Strategy**
   ```javascript
   // Progressive enhancement approach
   if (window.matchMedia("(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)").matches) {
     // Disable non-essential animations
   }
   ```

3. **Mobile Considerations**
   - Simplified animations on touch devices
   - Reduced parallax effects
   - Touch-optimized interactions
   - 60fps target on all devices

#### Specific Animation Examples

1. **Corporate Logo Reveal** (Homepage)
   - Elements fade in sequentially
   - Subtle scale from 0.95 to 1
   - Duration: 0.8s with expo.out easing

2. **Marble Pattern Morph** (Encyclopedia)
   - Smooth transitions between marble types
   - Morphing pattern overlays
   - Interactive zoom on hover

3. **Lead Form Success**
   - Form morphs into success message
   - Checkmark draws in with DrawSVG
   - Subtle celebration particles (corporate-appropriate)

4. **Number Counters**
   - Smooth counting animations
   - Formatted with commas
   - Triggered on viewport entry

#### Accessibility Considerations
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`
- Provide pause controls for auto-playing content
- Ensure animations don't interfere with screen readers
- Maintain keyboard navigation functionality
- Include skip animation options

#### Animation Timing Guidelines
- Micro-interactions: 200-300ms
- Content reveals: 400-600ms
- Page transitions: 600-800ms
- Complex sequences: 1000-1500ms max
- Stagger delays: 50-150ms

### 8.3 UX Requirements

#### Navigation
- Sticky header with quick actions
- Mega menu for services
- Breadcrumb navigation
- Quick contact floating button
- Search functionality

#### Mobile Experience
- Thumb-friendly tap targets
- Swipe gestures for galleries
- Optimized form inputs
